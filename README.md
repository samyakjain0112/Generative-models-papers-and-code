# Generative models implementation

# Framework used:
PYTORCH

# CONTENTS

This repository at present contains the implementation of the following:
1) Test results, latent space interpolation and Latent space 2-D visualization folder
2) Deterministic Convolutional Autoencoder on mnist and cifar10
3) Sparse Autoencoder on mnist and cifar-10
3) Generative Adversarial Networks on mnist
4) Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks on mnist
6) Adversarial Autoencoder (Only the supervised AAE is added at present) on mnist
